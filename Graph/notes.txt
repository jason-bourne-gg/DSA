BFS (Breadth-First Search)

Time Complexity:

Undirected Graphs: O(N + 2 * E) (N = number of nodes, E = number of edges)
Directed Graphs: O(N + E)
Explanation: Traversing all nodes and edges in the worst case.
Space Complexity:

Both Graphs: O(N) (vis + queue)
DFS (Depth-First Search)

Time Complexity:

Undirected Graphs: O(N + 2 * E) + O(N) (for recursion stack)
Directed Graphs: O(N + E)
Explanation: Traversing all nodes and edges in the worst case, plus additional overhead for recursion.
Space Complexity:

Both Graphs: O(N) (vis + recursion stack)
